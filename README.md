# hub-server

This is a repository that guides you through the setup to generate a server that will work with the source on this site.

The Source you will use on your server is located in the "source" folder.

## Setup Server

[Setup instructions](https://github.com/style-hub/hub-server/blob/master/setup-server.md)

## Project goals

Build a web site with hubs that manage community contributed files for style, layout and maybe more.

The goal is to create a site that requires very little from the contributor and makes it as effortless at possible to download and use the resources.

## Why not use the Resource Sharing Plugin?

This is NOT a replacement for the plugin. But it is a way to significantly lower the bar for the majority of ordinary users to contribute, but also find and download the resources. Some resources is deffinetly not suitable to manage with a "hub" site. And the resources on a hub could easily be pulled to a resource sharing repository and shared that way too.
